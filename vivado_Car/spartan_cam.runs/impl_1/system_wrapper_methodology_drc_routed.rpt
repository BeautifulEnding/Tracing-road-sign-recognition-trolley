LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell system_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) system_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning

Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT system_i/csi2_d_phy_rx_0/U0/clock_system_inst/dly_gen.BUFGCTRL_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology.

There is a large setup violation of -3.161 ns between system_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Performance.Core/Decode_I/mem_gpr_write_addr_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_0_1_1) and system_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Performance.Core/Data_Flow_I/Operand_Select_I/EX_Branch_CMP_Op1_reg[18]/D (clocked by clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_0_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock system_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin system_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-30#1 Warning
Sub-optimal master source pin selection for generated clock  
The generated clock system_i/rgb2dvi_0/U0/SerialClk has a sub-optimal master source pin selection, timing can be pessimistic
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-36#1 Warning
Invalid Generated Clock due to missing edge propagation  
There is no rising/falling edge propagation between master clock clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_1_0 to generated clock system_i/rgb2dvi_0/U0/SerialClk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-38#1 Warning
Bus skew constraint applied on multiple clocks  
Multiple clocks involved on source or destination of a bus skew constraint (see constraint position 30 in the Timing Constraint Window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to have only one source clock and one destination clock per bus skew constraint. First endpoint covered by the constraint: system_i/v_vid_in_axi4s_0/inst/COUPLER_INST/generate_async_fifo.FIFO_INST/XPM_FIFO_ASYNC_INST/gnuram_async_fifo.xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_cdc_pntr.rd_pntr_cdc_inst/dest_graysync_ff_reg[0][0]/D

TIMING-38#2 Warning
Bus skew constraint applied on multiple clocks  
Multiple clocks involved on source or destination of a bus skew constraint (see constraint position 32 in the Timing Constraint Window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to have only one source clock and one destination clock per bus skew constraint. First endpoint covered by the constraint: system_i/v_vid_in_axi4s_0/inst/COUPLER_INST/generate_async_fifo.FIFO_INST/XPM_FIFO_ASYNC_INST/gnuram_async_fifo.xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_cdc_pntr.wr_pntr_cdc_inst/dest_graysync_ff_reg[0][0]/D

TIMING-38#3 Warning

Multiple clocks involved on source or destination of a bus skew constraint (see constraint position 38 in the Timing Constraint Window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to have only one source clock and one destination clock per bus skew constraint.

It is recommended to have only one source clock and one destination clock per bus skew constraint.

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '25' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
